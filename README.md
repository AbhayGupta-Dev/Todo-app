# Todo-app
A simple Python To-Do List app with SQLite. Add tasks, delete them, and keep everything saved locally. Built with customtkinter for a clean interface and designed to just work — no internet needed.

# **📝 To-Do List Task Manager (SQLite)**

This is a simple Python desktop app I made for managing daily tasks. It’s built with tkinter for the interface and SQLite for saving tasks locally. The idea was to keep it clean, easy to use, and not depend on internet or external services.

**What it does**

Add a new task from the input box

Delete a selected task from the list

Saves all tasks in a local SQLite database

Automatically loads tasks when you restart the app

Basic buttons with colors (blue = add, red = delete)

---

**How it looks**

Title bar says “To-Do List”

Heading in the middle → “Task Manager”

Text field at the top to type your task

List box below that shows all your tasks

Two buttons at the bottom: Add Task (blue) and Delete Task (red)

### **How to run**

You’ll need:

Python 3

customtkinter  (pip install customtkinter)

tkinter (comes with Python)

sqlite3 (also comes with Python)


**Then just run:**

python todo.py

Notes

I kept the design very minimal so it’s not distracting. The layout can easily be extended later with things like deadlines, categories, or priorities if needed.

Nothing fancy here — just a small, reliable app that does its job.
